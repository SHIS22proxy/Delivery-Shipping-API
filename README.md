# Delivery & Shipping API Documentation

## 1. Introduction

### Overview  
The **Delivery & Shipping API** manages the calculation, assignment, tracking, and management of shipping methods and delivery information in e-commerce platforms and logistics systems. It interfaces with carriers (e.g., FedEx, DHL, UPS) or internal delivery fleets to automate and streamline order fulfillment.

### Why It Matters  
Shipping accuracy, speed, and cost-efficiency are vital to customer satisfaction and retention. An API that abstracts shipping logic reduces manual errors, enables real-time tracking, and integrates with global carriers.

### Who This Guide is For  
- Backend/API developers building e-commerce platforms  
- Logistics and operations engineers  
- 3PL (Third-party logistics) integrators  
- Delivery management systems  
- Admin or fulfillment dashboards

## 2. Key Terminology

- **Carrier**: External shipping provider (e.g., UPS, FedEx)  
- **Shipping Rate**: Price calculated for a given delivery based on size, weight, and destination  
- **Fulfillment**: The process of preparing and shipping an order  
- **Delivery Window**: Expected timeframe for delivery  
- **Tracking Number**: Unique ID for tracing package movement  
- **Last-Mile Delivery**: Final stage of shipment from local center to customer  
- **Shipment Label**: Barcode-ready document used for dispatch  
- **Zone-Based Pricing**: Rates based on shipping zones  
- **Multi-Origin Shipping**: Splitting an order shipped from multiple warehouses  
- **Webhook**: Mechanism for tracking updates in real-time

5. Best Practices
Use Caching for Static Rates: Avoid overloading carrier APIs

Retry on Label Generation Errors: Often due to timeouts or format issues

Normalize Addresses: Use validation tools before label creation

Auto-Assign Carriers Based on SLA: Optimize based on speed, cost, region

Audit All Shipment Events: For compliance and troubleshooting

Use Webhooks: For real-time tracking updates

Fail Gracefully on Carrier Downtime: Fallback to other carriers or retry queues

6. Common Issues & Troubleshooting
Issue	Description	Fix
Shipping cost is too high	Incorrect weight or dimensions	Verify product metadata
Label not generated	Carrier integration failed	Check carrier credentials or API limits
Tracking number not updating	Delay from carrier	Wait or refresh manually
Address validation failed	Format or country mismatch	Use address validation API
API timeout from FedEx	Carrier overload or auth issue	Retry with exponential backoff
